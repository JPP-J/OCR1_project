This repository contains the complete codebase for Jidapa's *OCR extract text from picture Project*.


## üìå Overview

This project provides an end-to-end system to extract text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), wrapped in a web application and deployed on the cloud for easy access and scalability.

### üß© Problem Statement

Many organizations still rely heavily on paper documents and scanned images for record-keeping and data entry. Manually extracting text from these images is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. Automating this process with OCR technology faces challenges such as varying image quality, complex layouts, and diverse fonts. Additionally, providing a user-friendly, reliable API and web interface‚Äîwhile ensuring seamless deployment and continuous updates‚Äîadds to the complexity of building a robust OCR solution.


### üîç Approach

The system uses **Tesseract OCR** to process images and extract text, integrated within a **Flask** web application that exposes an API endpoint for text extraction. The entire app is containerized using **Docker** and orchestrated with **docker-compose** for portability. Deployment is automated to **AWS EC2** using **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD, enabling rapid, stable delivery.

### üé¢ Processes

1. **Image Input** ‚Äì Accept image URLs through API/web interface  
2. **Preprocessing** ‚Äì Use `opencv-python` for image enhancements if needed  
3. **OCR Extraction** ‚Äì Apply `pytesseract` to convert images to text  
4. **Web Service** ‚Äì Serve OCR functionality through Flask API with WSGI setup (Gunicorn + Nginx)  
5. **Containerization** ‚Äì Package the app and dependencies with Docker for consistent environments  
6. **Deployment & CI/CD** ‚Äì Automate testing, build, and deployment pipelines via GitHub Actions to AWS EC2 instances  

### üéØ Results & Impact

- Provides reliable text extraction from a variety of image sources  
- Enables easy integration via API for other applications  
- Ensures scalable and maintainable deployment through containerization and CI/CD  
- Demonstrated end-to-end pipeline from OCR to cloud deployment  
- **Helps organizations that work with paper-based documents to automate data extraction, significantly reducing manual labor and saving time for employees.**  

### ‚öôÔ∏è Challenges and Considerations

- Handling different image qualities and noisy backgrounds impacting OCR accuracy  
- Optimizing Flask API performance for concurrent requests  
- Ensuring seamless CI/CD workflows with Docker and AWS integration  
- Maintaining security and stability in cloud deployment environments
